This is a project to lay out ("engrave") the music edition of the Echoes of
Grace hymnbook. It is believed by the publisher (Bible Truth Publishers of
Addison, Illinois, USA) that all contained songs, in both lyric and musical
content, are no longer protected by copyright, and this restoration work is
undertaken in good faith that this is true.

This project constitutes my first experience with the Lilypond engraving
system, as well as my first attempt at music engraving in general, and as such
is potentially fraught with errors and insufficiencies. The reader is invited
to provide criticisms and feedback of any kind to the below address.
